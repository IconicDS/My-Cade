# My-Cade
My-Cade is an open-source piece of software for DIY arcade cabinets with the ability to navigate with joysticks, Xbox controllers, or keyboard and mouse.

This software was developed in Flutter. All of the source code you can find on this page and edit as you would like.

I would like to update the design and transitions later on. So stay tuned for updates and implement your own if you would like to contribute to this project!
